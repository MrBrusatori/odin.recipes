        <p>You <strong><em>don't</em></strong> have to be Irish to celebrate St. Patrick's Day because, as the saying goes, <strong><em>Everybody’s</em></strong> Irish on St. Patrick’s Day’</p>
        <p>Instead of the <em>usual</em> few cheeky pints of the black stuff, cook up a feast this year using some of the <strong><em>best</em></strong> that Ireland has to offer. <strong>Irish beef and sausage</strong> are among the best around - the rich grazing pastures being the upside of <em>all</em> of that drizzle.</p>
        <p>Here you will find some of the best, most traditional and themed <strong>Irish dishes</strong>.</p>
